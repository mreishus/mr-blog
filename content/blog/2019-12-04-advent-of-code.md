I'm participating in the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) this
year. It's a programming challenge released each day for the first 25 days of
december. In 2018, I completed all problems within 24 hours of being released
(including the notorious day 15); I hope to repeat that performance this year.
Check out [my solutions](https://github.com/mreishus/aoc) on github or [join
the event](https://adventofcode.com/) yourself.

Update 2019-12-26: I've completed all 50 stars and even landed on the global
leaderboard once. It was a blast. Check out my writeups for the event and each
problem in [my AoC repository](https://github.com/mreishus/aoc).
